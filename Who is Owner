On a adding a new contract into the chain a new account is created that can't be changed which will be loaded into a VM runs the constructor part, initialize fields on creating objects that refer the contract(byte) code and database.
Owner of the contract will be the one the contract is deployed. Owner for a contract can be set as below.

1. Using direct owner information from the wallet address where contract is deployed.


pragma solidity ^0.4.11;

contract MyToken{

    address public data;

    function getAddress() returns (address){
        data = msg.sender;
    }
}


My Address in MetaMask is : 0x279a0B9ac8D6174B7b4f8E636D10803513A08Cdb

I am running the contract and trying to see the data is filling correctly or not.

Initially my Address in data variable is : "0: address: 0x0"

Below Transaction approval process.

transact to browser/MyToken.sol:MyToken.getAddress pending ...
[block:2073960 txIndex:4] from:0x279...08cdb, to:browser/MyToken.sol:MyToken.getAddress() 0x814...bd9d9, value:0 wei, 0 logs, data:0x38c...c4831, hash:0x39a...2fef1
